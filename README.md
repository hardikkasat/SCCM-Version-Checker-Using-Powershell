# SCCM-Version-Checker-Using-Powershell
A PowerShell script that remotely checks the SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) client version on multiple servers. The script retrieves server names from a text file, tests the WinRM connection, and handles potential errors like unreachable servers or connection failures, exporting the results to a CSV file.
